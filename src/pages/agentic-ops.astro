        RevOps gave us workflows, integrations, and dashboards. It was a leap forward.
        But the next leap isn't more automation — it's autonomy. That's Agentic Ops.

      <h2>The problem with RevOps today</h2>
      <p>
        RevOps was born from a real need: align sales, marketing, and customer success
        around shared data and processes. It worked. We got cleaner CRMs, better reporting,
        and automated handoffs.
      </p>
      <p>
        But here's the thing nobody talks about: most RevOps teams are drowning. They're
        buried in ticket queues, data hygiene tasks, manual enrichment, report building,
        and integration maintenance. The workflows they built created more work, not less.
      </p>
      <p>
        The average RevOps professional spends the majority of their time on tasks that
        are repetitive, rule-based, and — critically — <strong>delegatable to an AI agent</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>What changes with Agentic Ops</h2>
      <p>
        Agentic Ops is a simple shift in mindset: instead of building workflows that
        <em>humans execute</em>, you deploy agents that <em>execute autonomously</em>
        while humans supervise and strategize.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn't about "using AI" in the vague way everyone claims to. This is about
        deploying discrete, purpose-built AI agents — using tools like Claude, Relevance AI,
        and custom-built systems — that handle specific GTM functions end-to-end.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "The best RevOps teams won't be the ones with the most automations. They'll be the
        ones who deploy the best agents."
      </blockquote>

      <h2>The four layers of the Agentic GTM Stack</h2>
      <p>
        Every GTM operation can be broken into four agent-addressable layers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prospecting agents</strong> — Find, qualify, and prioritize leads. Build lists,
        research accounts, identify buying signals. No more manual prospecting.</li>
        <li><strong>Enrichment agents</strong> — Clean, enrich, deduplicate, route, and score
        data across your CRM and data warehouse. Always running, always current.</li>
        <li><strong>Content agents</strong> — Draft personalized outreach, create follow-up sequences,
        generate reports and summaries. Human-quality output at machine scale.</li>
        <li><strong>Reporting agents</strong> — Pull data, surface anomalies, build dashboards,
        and deliver insights proactively. Analytics that come to you, not the other way around.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why now?</h2>
      <p>
        Three things converged to make Agentic Ops possible:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Foundation models got good enough.</strong> Claude, GPT-4, and others can now
        handle nuanced business tasks — not just chat, but actual execution with judgment.</li>
        <li><strong>Agent frameworks matured.</strong> Tools like Relevance AI, LangChain, and
        custom agent architectures make it practical to deploy agents without a PhD in ML.</li>
        <li><strong>The economics work.</strong> An agent that runs 24/7 costs a fraction of the
        human hours it replaces. The ROI isn't theoretical anymore — I've seen it firsthand.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who this is for</h2>
      <p>
        Agentic Ops isn't for everyone yet. It's for the operators who are already comfortable
        with RevOps fundamentals and are ready to push into the next frontier. If you're still
        figuring out your CRM hygiene basics, do that first.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if you're the kind of person who looks at a manual process and thinks
        "an agent could do this" — you're in the right place.
      </p>

      <h2>Where to start</h2>
      <p>
        Start with one agent. Pick your most repetitive, time-consuming GTM task. Build an agent
        that handles 80% of it. Supervise it for a week. Iterate. Then move to the next one.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's the Agentic Ops playbook: deploy, supervise, iterate, expand.
      </p>
      <p>
        I write about this every week in the <a href="/" class="text-accent hover:text-accent-hover underline">Agentic Ops newsletter</a>,
        and I share the specific agents I'm deploying, the tools I'm using, and the frameworks
        that actually work.
