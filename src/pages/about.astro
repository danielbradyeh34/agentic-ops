          I'm a GTM operations professional who builds and deploys AI agents across the
          go-to-market stack. While most teams are still debating whether to "use AI,"
          I'm already in production.
        </p>

        <h2>What I do</h2>
        <p>
          I work at the intersection of AI and go-to-market operations. My day job is
          in-house GTM/RevOps, where I architect and deploy autonomous agents that handle
          prospecting, data enrichment, content generation, and reporting.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not a consultant who talks about AI in theory. I'm an operator who deploys
          agents in production — using tools like Claude Code, Relevance AI, and custom-built
          systems — and sees what actually works versus what's just hype.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Agentic Ops</h2>
        <p>
          I coined the term "Agentic Ops" because I believe we're at an inflection point.
          RevOps gave us process and structure. Agentic Ops gives us autonomous execution.
          The operators who figure this out first will have an unfair advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most people in GTM are confused about AI agents. They don't know what agents are,
          where to start, or which tools to trust. There are hundreds of platforms, conflicting
          advice, and a lot of vaporware. I cut through that by sharing what I'm actually
          building and deploying — no fluff, no vendor pitches.
